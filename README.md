# ABOUT-ME BEYOND ACADEMICS 

My artistic passion extends beyond creation to purpose, as I launched an art business during the COVID-19 pandemic. This venture allows me to sell prints of my work with a significant portion of the proceeds directed to ACCESS, a charity I strongly believe in, blending my love for art with a commitment to social impact.

Athletics have been a constant thread throughout my life, beginning with track and field at a very young age and competing all through school. While I have chosen not to pursue it at the collegiate level, the discipline and camaraderie from those years have left a lasting impression, making it a cherished part of my personal history.

My musical journey started at the age of eight with the keyboard, which I developed to a professional standard by the time I was twelve. This dedication was formally recognized with a Grade 3 certification from the Trinity College of London, marking a significant achievement in my technical and artistic development.

In my junior year of high school, I discovered an interest in the logical and creative world of coding. I began with Python and MySQL and have continued to enjoy the process of problem-solving and building through programming ever since.

My interest in fashion is a personal canvas where I enjoy blending chic and casual aesthetics. I often work with a foundational palette of black and white, accentuated by bold prints like leopard. This style is completed with carefully chosen statement pieces, such as elegant handbags and jewelry, to create a cohesive and expressive look.

I am also an enthusiastic traveler, driven by a desire to explore new cultures and places. Each journey is an opportunity to broaden my global perspective and gain a deeper understanding of the world, which I find both inspiring and essential to my personal growth.each out to collaborate! 🚀
